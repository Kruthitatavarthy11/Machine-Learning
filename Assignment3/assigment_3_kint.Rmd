## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r bank_data_assign3}
summary(bank_data_assign3)
library("readr")
library("caret")
library("dplyr")
library("tidyr")
library("reshape2")
library("e1071")

#Import Universalbank.csv file from local 
bank_data_assign3 <- read.csv("C:/Users/Kruthi Tatavarthy/Documents/Masters in Business Analytics/Sem-1/Machine Learning/UniversalBank.csv")
head(bank_data_assign3)

bank_data_assign3$Personal.Loan <- as.factor(bank_data_assign3$Personal.Loan)
bank_data_assign3$Online <- as.factor(bank_data_assign3$Online)
bank_data_assign3$CreditCard <- as.factor(bank_data_assign3$CreditCard)

#Setting Seed
set.seed(2022)

training_data_index = createDataPartition(bank_data_assign3$Personal.Loan, p=.6, list = F) #60% training data
training_data_df = bank_data_assign3[training_data_index,]
validation_data_df = bank_data_assign3[-training_data_index,] #Validation Data

#Question 1: 

melt_bank_data_assign3 = melt(training_data_df, id=c("CreditCard","Personal.Loan"), variable = "Online") #function melt() 
dcast_bank_data_assign3 = dcast(melt_bank_data_assign3, CreditCard+Personal.Loan~Online) #function cast()
dcast_bank_data_assign3[,c(1:2,14)] # CreditCard, Personal.Loan, Online DF

#Question 2:

#Answer: the probability of customer accepingt the loan is calculated as 93/3000=3.1% 

#Question 3: 

loan_melt_bank_data_assign3 = melt(training_data_df, id=c("Personal.Loan"), variable = "Online")
cc_melt_bank_data_assign3 = melt(training_data_df, id=c("CreditCard"), variable = "Online")
dcast_loan_bank_data_assign3 = dcast(loan_melt_bank_data_assign3, Personal.Loan~Online)
dcast_cc_bank_data_assign3 = dcast(cc_melt_bank_data_assign3, CreditCard~Online)

dcast_loan_bank_data_assign3[,c(1,13)]
dcast_cc_bank_data_assign3[,c(1,14)]

#Question 4

#1. P(CC = 1 | Loan = 1) (the proportion of credit card holders among the loan acceptors)
#calculation: 93/(93+195) is eqiual to 32.29%
table(training_data_df[,c(14,10)])

#2. P(Online = 1 | Loan = 1)  
#Calculation: 179/(179+109) is equal to 62.15%
table(training_data_df[,c(13,10)])

#3. P(Loan = 1) (the proportion of loan acceptors) 
#Calculation: 288/(288+2712) is equal to 9.6%
table(training_data_df[c(10)])

#4. P(CC = 1 | Loan = 0)  
#Calculation: 788/(788+1924) is equal to 29% 

#5. P(Online = 1 | Loan = 0)
#Calculation: 1631/(1631+1081) = 60%

#6. P(Loan = 0)
#Calculation: 2712/(2712+288) = 90.4% 

#Question 5

#Calculation: ((93/(93+195))* (179/(179+109))* (288/(288+2712)))/((93/(93+195))* (179/(179+109))* (288/(288+2712))) + ((788/(788+1924)) * (1631/(1631+1081)) * (2712/(2712+288))) = 0.1087106

#Question 6: 

#Answer: 0.1 which is approximately same as the calculation in answer 5.
#Independent variable were needed for the calculated method in this answer mainly to predict, 
#But, we don't need the independent varialbles for Naive Bayes.

#Question 7: 

train_naive_bayes = training_data_df[,c(10,13:14)]
naive_bayes = naiveBayes(Personal.Loan~., data=train_naive_bayes)
naive_bayes
